     <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Panna Cotta is a classic Italian dessert known for its silky, creamy texture. 
        The name means "cooked cream" in Italian. 
        It's typically flavored with vanilla and served chilled, often with a fruit sauce or fresh berries.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>2 cups (500 ml) heavy cream</li>

        <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) whole milk</li>

        <li>1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract (or 1 vanilla bean)</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract (or 1 vanilla bean)</li>

        <li>2 ½ teaspoons (1 packet) unflavored gelatin</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons cold water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bloom the Gelatin:
            In a small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over the cold water and let it sit for 5–10 minutes to soften.</li>

        <li>Heat the Cream Mixture:
            In a saucepan, combine the heavy cream, milk, and sugar. 
            Heat over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves and mixture is hot (do not boil)</li>

        <li>Add Gelatin & Vanilla:
            Remove from heat. Stir in the bloomed gelatin until completely dissolved. 
            Then add the vanilla extract (or scrape the seeds from a vanilla bean into the mixture).</li>

        <li>Pour into Molds:
            Strain the mixture through a fine sieve if desired, then pour into lightly greased ramekins or molds.</li>

        <li>Chill:
            Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until fully set.</li>

        <li>Serve:
            Unmold onto plates and top with berry sauce and mint if using.</li>
    </ol>
