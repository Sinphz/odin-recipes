    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert known for its rich, creamy texture and bold coffee flavor. 
        It consists of layers of coffee-soaked ladyfinger biscuits and a smooth mascarpone cheese mixture, 
        topped with a dusting of cocoa powder.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>6 egg yolks</li>

        <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>

        <li>1 cup (240ml) heavy cream</li>

        <li>1 cup (240g) mascarpone cheese</li>

        <li>2 cups (480ml) strong brewed espresso or coffee, cooled</li>

        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) coffee liqueur (optional, e.g., Kahlúa)</li>

        <li>1 pack of ladyfinger biscuits (about 24 pieces)</li>

        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder (for dusting)</li>

        <li>Dark chocolate shavings (optional)</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the mascarpone filling:
        In a heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together. 
        Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler) 
        and whisk constantly for about 8–10 minutes until thick and pale. 
        Let it cool slightly. Beat in mascarpone until smooth.</li><br>

        <li>Whip the cream:
        In a separate bowl, beat the heavy cream to stiff peaks. 
        Gently fold it into the mascarpone mixture until fully combined.</li><br>
s
        <li>Prepare the coffee soak:
        In a shallow bowl, combine the espresso and coffee liqueur (if using).</li><br>

        <li>Assemble the tiramisu:
        Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture (don’t soak them too long or they’ll get soggy) 
        and line the bottom of a dish. Spread half the mascarpone filling over the soaked ladyfingers.
        Add another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the rest of the filling.</li><br>

        <li>Chill and finish:
        Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours (preferably overnight). 
        Before serving, dust with cocoa powder and top with chocolate shavings if desired.</li><br>
 
    </ol>
