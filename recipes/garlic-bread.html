    <p>Garlic bread is a popular side dish made with slices of bread (typically baguette or Italian bread) 
        topped with a savory mixture of butter, garlic, and herbs. 
        It's baked until crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, 
        often served with pasta, soups, or as an appetizer.</p>
